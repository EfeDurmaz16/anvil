# Anvil

> Open-source multi-agent platform that modernizes legacy code (COBOL, Perl, Fortran) into modern TypeScript, Python, or Go — with enterprise regression gates and proof packs.

## Overview

Anvil is a CLI tool and multi-agent system that reads legacy source code, extracts business logic, and generates modern target code via pluggable target adapters. It is designed for on‑prem / customer VPC deployments where data must not leave the perimeter.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent pipeline: Cartographer, Specular, Architect, Judge
- Supports COBOL, Perl, and Fortran as source languages
- Generates TypeScript/Python/Go (and more) via target plugins
- Works offline with template-based generation (LLM optional; supports local OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
- Manifest-based harness runners for target-agnostic regression
- Built on Temporal.io for production-grade orchestration (optional)

## Quick Start

```bash
go install github.com/efebarandurmaz/anvil/cmd/anvil@latest

anvil run --source cobol --target typescript \
    --input ./your-cobol-src \
    --output ./generated

# Run regression gates and produce a proof pack:
anvil harness run --fixtures ./fixtures.jsonl --code ./generated --output ./proof-pack
```
